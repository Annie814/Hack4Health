# Hack4Health - Nutrition App

Team: Luna, Annie, Ray, Michael

The proposal is at: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ByBsf0LQUZiPADH4iu5KVkld3q4h4POWfyimPDTz1d4/edit?usp=sharing

Front-end was built using HTML5 Boilerplate (https://html5boilerplate.com) as a starting point.

We will make an API call to get nutrition data for food items.

We have a MySQL database for storage.

Main Front-end files so far are:

- index.html
- css/styles.css
- js/main.js
